PCells
---------------

What is a PCell
***************

PCell stands for parametric cell, a well-known concept in layout design for the dynamical creation of devices.
A PCell is a piece of code where the designer can create geometric primitives by adjusting the design parameters.


A ``PCell`` in ``palgds`` is based on ``gdstk.Cell`` class. A cell is a fundamental structure in the layout.
It is composed of basic geometrical elements (polygons and paths) and references to other cells. For more information
see `GDSTK`_ library. We suggest you learn the basics of GDSTK library (Cell, Library, Polygons, Paths, References)
before going further.

A ``PCell`` is a class that inherits from the ``gdstk.Cell`` class, and it extends the functionality of
``gdstk.Cell`` to be used as a parametric cell. In addition, a ``PCell`` also has ``ports`` attribute that stores the
properties of the inputs and outputs of a ``PCell``.

Creating PCells
***************

In this section, we will create a parametric ``RingResonator`` class to explain how a ``PCell`` works.
Start your code with following imports:

.. code-block:: python

    import gdstk
    import numpy as np
    import palgds.base_cells as bc

Every class that you create for building layout should inherit from ``PCell`` class. In the ``__init__()`` method,
you can include many parameters that you can adjust while creating a ring resonator. Using these parameters, you can
create the geometric layout elements. These geometric elements will be a ring and a bus waveguide in a basic ring
resonator. See the following code:

.. literalinclude:: _tutorial/pcell.py
    :start-at: class RingResonator(bc.PCell)
    :end-at: "out": bc.Port((radius, 0), 0, "op"),})

After creating ``RingResonator`` class, we can create an instance of it. Thanks to the parametric implementation, 
we can easily create variants of ring resonators. Let's create a ring resonator object with
radius of 5 :math:`\mu m`, coupling gap of 0.2 :math:`\mu m`, and line-width of 0.45 :math:`\mu m`:

.. code-block:: python

    ring_res = RingResonator(name="RingRes", radius=5, gap=0.2, width=0.45)
    ring_res.write_svg("RingRes.svg")

.. image:: _source_files/RingRes.svg
    :align: center

You can export the GDSII layout using a library:

.. code-block:: python
    
    lib = gdstk.Library()
    lib.add(ring_res, *ring_res.dependencies(True))
    lib.write_gds("RingRes.gds", max_points=4000)


Here, we created the elements of the ``RingResonator`` in ``_create_elements`` method.
The elements, ring and bus waveguide, are created using ``gdstk.ellipse`` and ``gdstk.rectangle`` functions
by providing appropriate parameters.

``ports`` is created in ``_create_ports`` method. ``ports`` is a python ``dict`` that stores the port objects.
Every port is an instance of ``Port`` class containing the properties of the port.
The ports in a pcell are defined in the following way:

**Ports definition:** ``{name1: Port(position, angle, port_type), name2: ... }``

``name`` is the name of the port, ``position`` is a tuple of two numbers `(x, y)`, ``angle`` is the orientation of the
port in radians, and ``port_type`` is the type of the port: either ``"op"`` for optical ports or ``"el"``
for electrical ports.

Currently, we will not use the ports but they will be very important when creating circuits from PCells. Finally,
let's display the string representations of ``ring_res`` object and its ports:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> print(ring_res)
    PCell <RingResonator> name:'RingRes' with 2 ports, 2 polygons, 0 paths, 0 references, and 0 labels

    >>> print(ring_res.ports)
    {'in': Port(position=(-5.000, 0.000), angle=3.142, port_type=op),
     'out': Port(position=(5.000, 0.000), angle=0.000, port_type=op)}
